1.Package.json is the configuration file for NPM.
2.NPM doesnt stands for Node Package Manager
3.package-lock.json (manages the version of the depenceies of the package.json) 
4.React doesnt track all the variables ... it only keeps the track of some specaial variables called states...
Whenever the state changes react re-renders the BodyComponent

states are defined using a special hook or a react inbuild hook or function called by the name of the hook

React internal use diff algorithm to compare virtual doms which are just javascript objects

react fiber is the new diff algorithm used by react

it also uses some reconsolidation algorithm

re-render which menas also function is callled again and react exactly know what is to be updated

for every ui  change we do we need state


// Very Very important

React Component only re-render two times when something get changed in
1.state
2.props


useEffect will be called just after the inital render of the Component

1.useEffect with no depenceies array:- called every time Component re-renders
2.useEffect with empty depenceies array:- called on first render only
3.useEffect with filled depenceies array:- called first and every time the dependent variable changes
